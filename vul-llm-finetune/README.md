## Folder structure

You can find the following folders in the root directory:
- Folder `ContraBERT` contains the code of the ContraBERT model, which was used in the paper;
- Folder `Datasets` contains two versions of the dataset used in the paper: $X_1$ with $P_3$ and $X_1$ without $P_3$. Part $P_3$ stands for a set of random unchanged functions from vulnerability fixing commits;
- Folder `LineVul` contains the code of the LineVul model, which can be used to run with the ContraBERT model;
- Folder `LLM` contains the code for finetuning LLMs using the next token prediction or classification losses with the function batch packing technique.
